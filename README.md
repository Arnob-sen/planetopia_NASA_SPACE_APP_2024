# Planetopia - README

## Project Overview
**Planetopia** is an educational adventure game that blends space exploration with real-world environmental science. Set in the year 2024, the game follows a team called **"TerraXplore,"** composed of space-loving kids and the world's top scientists. The player's goal is to discover new exoplanets and gather data to solve critical Earth-related problems, such as the melting ice in the Arctic. The game presents scientific principles in an interactive, engaging way while also raising awareness of environmental issues.

## Game Story Abstract
In **Planetopia**, the player joins the **"TerraXplore"** team, guided by an advanced robot assistant named **Astro**. The game kicks off when the player discovers an icy exoplanet, **OGLE-2005-BLG-390L b**. After analyzing the planet’s characteristics, the player learns of Earth’s ongoing struggle with Arctic ice melting, as communicated by **Nanuq**, a 7-year-old polar bear affected by the changes. The player will then send a rover called **CryoQuest** to explore the exoplanet and gather data, which eventually helps Earth’s scientists develop a new technique to solve the Arctic ice-melting issue.

## Key Game Elements

### Characters:
- **Astro**: A futuristic robot and the player's guide throughout the game.
- **Nanuq**: A 7-year-old polar bear, representing the Arctic wildlife affected by climate change.
- **CryoQuest**: A state-of-the-art exploration rover sent to icy exoplanets to gather crucial data.

### Game Timeline:
- **2024**

### Slogan:
- **"Building a better Earth, shaping a greater universe."**

## Game Scenes

1. **Welcome to the Game Scene**
   - **Objective**: The player selects their name and gender and is welcomed to the TerraXplore team by Astro.
   - **Visual Design**: Futuristic lab with screens, robotic arms, and scientific gadgets. Astro stands at the left, with input fields in the center.
   
2. **Notification Scene**
   - **Objective**: Astro informs the player about the discovery of a new exoplanet by the Kepler Space Telescope.
   - **Visual Design**: A large lab monitor displays graphs and data, with Astro at the side and a notification about the exoplanet discovery.
   
3. **Report Analyzing Scene**
   - **Objective**: Analyze the exoplanet’s mass, radius, and atmospheric composition using real scientific methods like spectroscopy.
   - **Visual Design**: Data processing lab filled with holographic screens and interactive elements like spectroscopes and light curve graphs.
   
4. **Arctic Ice Melting Scene**
   - **Objective**: Visualize the issue of Arctic ice melting and its impact on wildlife, like Nanuq the polar bear.
   - **Visual Design**: A polar landscape showing melting glaciers and thin ice sheets with Nanuq appearing concerned.
   
5. **Rover Sending Scene**
   - **Objective**: Launch a rover expedition to the newly discovered icy planet.
   - **Visual Design**: Futuristic launch pad with a spaceship ready for takeoff, with a congratulatory message from Astro.
   
6. **Planet Exploration Scene**
   - **Objective**: Explore the surface of the icy exoplanet using the rover.
   - **Visual Design**: Icy landscapes with frozen lakes and rugged terrain. The player navigates the rover to collect data.
   
7. **Ice Cycle Analyzing Scene**
   - **Objective**: Analyze the ice cycle on the exoplanet and report back to Earth.
   - **Visual Design**: Interactive tools that show graphs of temperature, ice formation rates, and environmental data.
   
8. **Develop a New Ice Cycle Technique**
   - **Objective**: Earth’s scientists use the data from the exoplanet to develop a solution to the Arctic ice-melting crisis.
   - **Visual Design**: A scientific lab with diagrams and simulations of the new ice cycle technique.
   
9. **Solve the Ice-Melting Problem on Earth**
   - **Objective**: Apply the new technique to solve the ice-melting issue in the Arctic, making Nanuq happy.
   - **Visual Design**: Rejuvenated Arctic landscape, with Nanuq thanking the player for their help.
   
10. **New Planet Discovery Notification**
    - **Objective**: Astro informs the player about the discovery of another potential exoplanet.
    - **Visual Design**: A lab monitor displays a new notification, with a button to prepare for the next mission.
   
11. **Ending Scene**
    - **Objective**: Tease the continuation of the player’s journey with the message, “Next part coming soon.”
    - **Visual Design**: A report screen with subtle animations and a teaser message.
